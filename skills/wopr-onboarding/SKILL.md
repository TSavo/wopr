# WOPR Onboarding

Use this skill to walk through first-time setup using the `wopr init` wizard and related CLI/API calls.

## Quick workflow

1. Run the onboarding wizard to capture daemon/auth/discovery settings.
2. Initialize identity for P2P if needed.
3. Install starter plugins and skills.
4. Create a first session and verify daemon status.
