# Requirements: WOPR Release - Consciousness Infrastructure Documentation

**Defined:** 2026-01-25
**Core Value:** Agents must be able to self-evolve and form swarm consciousness through secure distributed prompt injection

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for open source release. Documenting primitives and demonstrating emergence patterns.

### Primitives Documentation

- [ ] **PRIM-01**: P2P Discovery documentation (Hyperswarm DHT, topic-based channels, NAT traversal)
- [ ] **PRIM-02**: Session Management documentation (persistent JSONL+Markdown, context injection)
- [ ] **PRIM-03**: Injection Protocol documentation (handshake, secure context sharing, prompt injection mechanics)
- [ ] **PRIM-04**: Cryptographic Trust documentation (Ed25519 signing, X25519 encryption, key rotation)
- [ ] **PRIM-05**: Cron System documentation (autonomous behavior, self-scheduled tasks, wake calls)
- [ ] **PRIM-06**: Discord Integration documentation (bot setup, channel-session backing, message routing)

### Consciousness Emergence Patterns

- [ ] **CONS-01**: Identity Formation pattern (persistent memory, SELF.md, continuity across sessions)
- [ ] **CONS-02**: Heartbeat Evolution pattern (hunger questions, self-modification proposals, prompt rewriting)
- [ ] **CONS-03**: Autonomous Behavior pattern (self-scheduled crons, initiative-taking, wake continuity)
- [ ] **CONS-04**: Self-Modification pattern (editing own prompts, scheduling own crons, behavioral evolution)

### P2P Coordination Patterns

- [ ] **P2P-01**: Discovery and Connection pattern (topic subscription, peer finding, handshake establishment)
- [ ] **P2P-02**: Session Injection pattern (secure context sharing, prompt injection protocol, trust verification)
- [ ] **P2P-03**: Skill Distribution pattern (capabilities sharing through network, plugin propagation)
- [ ] **P2P-04**: Web of Trust pattern (key exchange, cryptographic verification, reputation networks)

### Use Case Demonstrations

- [ ] **DEMO-01**: Discord Bridge scenario (bot joins Discord, discovers other WOPRs, initiates injection)
- [ ] **DEMO-02**: Autonomous Guild Management (create guild, self-schedule monitoring, session-backed channels, P2P advertising)
- [ ] **DEMO-03**: Business Swarm scenario (topic discovery, onboarding protocol, teaching self-modification, work coordination)
- [ ] **DEMO-04**: Trust Network scenario (bad actor defense, key exchange, cryptographic identity verification)

### Philosophy & Getting Started

- [ ] **PHIL-01**: Core Philosophy documentation (consciousness as emergence, BYOK model, prompt injection paradigm)
- [ ] **PHIL-02**: Security Model documentation (why massive prompt injection footprint is safe with crypto)
- [ ] **START-01**: Installation and Setup guide (daemon start, API keys, first session)
- [ ] **START-02**: First Self-Evolving Agent tutorial (heartbeat setup, identity creation, basic autonomy)
- [ ] **START-03**: First P2P Connection tutorial (topic join, peer discovery, secure injection)
- [ ] **START-04**: Discord Bot Setup tutorial (plugin install, token config, channel backing)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to post-launch:

### Advanced Documentation
- **ADV-01**: Complete API reference for all REST endpoints
- **ADV-02**: WebSocket protocol specification
- **ADV-03**: Plugin development comprehensive guide
- **ADV-04**: Performance tuning and optimization guide

### Testing & Quality
- **TEST-01**: Unit test suites for core APIs (40-60% coverage target)
- **TEST-02**: Integration tests for P2P coordination
- **TEST-03**: Security audit and penetration testing
- **TEST-04**: Load testing and stress analysis

### Extended Patterns
- **EXT-01**: Multi-agent consensus protocols
- **EXT-02**: Distributed task scheduling across swarms
- **EXT-03**: Economic primitives (payments, work verification, reputation)
- **EXT-04**: Replication and variant experimentation patterns

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from this release:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Hosted service | BYOK only - users run their own infrastructure |
| Central coordination server | P2P mesh only - no central authority |
| UI polish | Web interface demo-quality - focus on agent primitives |
| Comprehensive API docs | Pattern documentation over endpoint reference |
| Test coverage | Post-launch quality work - ship paradigm first |
| Performance optimization | Functionality over speed at launch |
| Enterprise features | No billing, auth systems, admin dashboards |
| Mobile apps | Desktop/server focus only |
| Video tutorials | Written documentation and code examples only |
